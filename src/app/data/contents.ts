    description: `
Oshin began her web development journey in 2024 with frontend development.

She challenged herself to work with a different language (Elixir) and framework (Phoenix) at an international tech company in Bangkok, where she became a frontend trainee in 2025.

Driven by curiosity and eagerness to improve, she learned backend development and SQL to manage databases. Now she is capable of full-stack development, aiming to grow into one of the high-quality developers of Thailand.`
